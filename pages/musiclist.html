The Legend Of Zelda constitutes many different games for different platforms, but they all have music at the heart of them. The main hero in the games, Link, often carries a flute, and in certain games players must help him to play the right musical motifs to progress. Aside from this more technical application, Kondo&#39;s music for the games takes on a gloriously pastoral character, taking no small influence from both John Williams and Ralph Vaughan Williams. That pastoral character is, for many, eternally bound up in nostalgia for the games themselves, but melodies this good work whether you&#39;ve played them or not."},

It should be noted that casinos in Mozart&#39;s day were venues where one often heard concerts, so probably it would not have proved too much of a problem for the players to be heard above the blackjack. Correspondence from the time suggests that Mozart went up to the wire when it came to putting in the composition work on this piece. The ink was, literally, still wet on the page when he gave it his first public performance. His father Leopold wrote in a letter to Mozart&#39;s sister Nannerl: &#39;&hellip;an excellent new piano concerto by Wolfgang, on which the copyist was still at work when we got there, and your brother didn&#39;t even have time to play through the rondo because he had to oversee the copying operation.&#39;"},

So at the outset, we know this is not going to be a bundle of laughs. Most famous for its Prelude, in which we hear the much-analysed Tristan Chord &mdash; which was to confound and fascinate critics and musicologists in equal measure &mdash; this is opera on an epic scale and worth sitting through all five hours of it for Isolde&#39;s final Liebestod. Initial reaction varied. Mark Twain, who hated it at Bayreuth, said, &#39;Sometimes I feel like the one sane person in the community of the mad.&#39; Clara Schumann said that Tristan was &#39;the most repugnant thing I have ever seen or heard in all my life&#39;. Nevertheless it had a profound effect on later composers and directly inspired such giants as Mahler, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg and Britten. Others including Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky deliberately formulated their styles in direct contrast to Wagner&#39;s."},

It was written for the Baroness d&#39;Este in 1834 and is similar to the final movement of Beethoven&#39;s &#39;Moonlight&#39; Sonata. Both pieces include melodies made up of furious semi-quavers and, like the Beethoven, Chopin&#39;s piece in C sharp minor. The term Impromptu first came about in the Romantic period and implies freedom, something which Chopin perfectly captures in his dizzying, joyful Fantaisie-Impromptu."},

It was written, along with the other Orchestral Suites, during the last period of the composer&#39;s life in Leipzig, around 1731. Bach&#39;s definition of &#39;orchestral&#39; is pretty loose. The group of musicians performing the work might be as small as a string quartet, a handful of woodwind players, some trumpets and a percussionist. Suite No. 3 is scored for three instrumental choirs &mdash; two oboes, three trumpets, timpani and strings.&nbsp; The Suite&#39;s second movement &mdash; the Air &mdash; was transcribed for strings by August Wilhelmj, which made it a party piece playable on only one string of a violin &mdash; hence its nickname &#39;Air on the G string&#39;. It has become one of the most famous pieces of Baroque music."},

Purcell composed one. So did Boyce. Charles Hubert Hastings Parry&#39;s setting, known by the &#39;incipit&#39; of the text as published in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, has become one of the most celebrated. Perhaps this is for the simple reason that it sets out to achieve musically exactly what the opening words say. From the moment it begins, it is throbbing with energy, and the first choral cloudburst of the words &#39;I was glad&#39; still sends a tingle down the spine, even on the hundredth hearing."},

It was published as part of a collection comprising of 12 instrumental concertos for a range of instruments, including violin, solo oboe, and two solo oboes. The second movement&#39;s poignant simplicity, with a sustained oboe line, accompanied by stately arpeggio figures in the strings, is worlds away from the speedy final movement, which acts as a vehicle for virtuosity, proving just how much variety a Baroque concerto can provide."},

By 1884, he was penning this, his final one. Worrying for a long time that the Symphony wasn&#39;t worthy of a full orchestra, Brahms originally had it performed in a setting for two pianos so he could get some feedback from a few trusted friends.

Hans Richter, who conducted its premiere proclaimed it to be Brahms&#39; &#39;Eroica&#39;. There is a risk that this symphony could suffer from a sort of musical version of middle-child syndrome. The novelty of the Symphony No.1, coupled with the fire and joy of the No.4, can leave the No.3 being almost forgotten.

So, along comes Mahler, inevitably a product of his day, but also a composer who was determined to break new ground. How did he do it? By applying a whole new meaning to the word &#39;orchestra&#39;.

Unfortunately, these time-consuming, large-scale works were not always the most efficient of payers. Luckily for Elgar, he had been befriended by a senior figure at the music publishers Novello. August Jaeger was someone who genuinely appreciated his music and he was immortalised as &#39;Nimrod&#39; in Elgar&#39;s Enigma Variations. In the 1880s Elgar retreated to Malvern, from where he wrote, bemoaning his fate to the ever-receptive Jaeger. Complaining of lean times, he sent Jaeger a violin piece called Evensong, suggesting the name could be changed to Vespers&nbsp;if needed. In the end, the publisher preferred to call the piece Chanson de Nuit. A couple of years later, Elgar wrote to Jaeger again, claiming to have recently rediscovered its companion piece. The two works provide a simple day-and-night contrast of styles, with Chanson de Nuit&nbsp;being very much the richer of the two. Chanson de Matin, as its name would suggest, is simpler and fresher."},

There is a section of the plot where Lermontov has the play&#39;s principal character, Nina, say, &#39;how beautiful the new waltz is!&#39; She goes on to describe a work somewhere between sorrow and joy. Perhaps it was the pressure of so naked a line, the plaudit weighing heavily on his shoulders that caused him the sleepless nights. Soon, with a little help from a friendly teacher, he had his theme and its exuberant place at the heart of this suite is probably the biggest single reason for its success."},

Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast, and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof, he denied having heard it.&#39; This has led many to speculate that the Prelude, Op. 28 No. 15 was directly influenced by Chopin&#39;s dream experience.

Mozart wrote specifically for the skills of the singers which included both experienced voices and ordinary comic actors.

But with Raiders of the Lost Ark, one of his most memorable works, the music means only one thing: Indiana Jones. The Raiders&rsquo; March, especially, has that undimmed knack for brilliant, sprightly melody and an immediate nostalgia, that sense that you&#39;ve always known how the tune goes.

Bach&#39;s reputation as a fine composer reached the ears of Kaiserling, so Goldberg was sent to him to be well tutored. When Bach heard of the plight of Goldberg&#39;s boss, he penned the work. It was a genre of music into which he had never before ventured, thinking variations almost a form of musical &#39;sheep counting&#39; (in the most respectful sense) and thus perfect for an insomniac. Luckily for Bach, and also for Goldberg, the new composition helped to ensure that Kaiserling was out for the count.

Their music certainly contained passion and emotion, but it was always restrained within set structures. These structures were becoming tired, though, and a new music was ready to burst forth. Step forward Beethoven, prepared once again to break the rules, and his status as the most important composer of his time was pretty much confirmed in an instant with this one mighty work."},

Perhaps there are three reasons for this: one, we&#39;re dealing with a genius composer; two, their solo nature forcing Bach to astound his listener with clever and sometimes fiendishly difficult ways of maximising the instrument; and three, the fact that the cello is often considered the nearest instrument to the human voice. It somehow captures the feeling of exposed honesty, of complete naturalness, as the greatest voices do."},

The gargantuan symphony orchestra would remain, but alongside it was placed an organ, an offstage brass ensemble, and some church bells. And a choir. A very large choir. And, to round things off, some soloists. It&#39;s little wonder that, whenever the Resurrection Symphony is performed, it&#39;s the only work on the programme."},

But, aside from an assertion to that effect by Beethoven&#39;s friend Schiller, there&#39;s very little evidence to suggest that it was the composer&#39;s intention. Instead, could it simply be the case that Beethoven&#39;s musical genius led him to write an outstanding, gripping melody?

The work was written for orchestra, but the composer went on to pen an arrangement that included a choir, although only the original version remains in regular performance today. It&#39;s thought that Faure probably added the chorus at the request of countess Greffulhe, a wealthy patron of the arts in Paris. The pavane began life as a sixteenth-century court dance, and is thought most likely to have originated in italy. Faure&#39;s take on the genre is a beautiful example, flowing grace fully and freely in a thoroughly enchanting way."},

The lack of a surviving manuscript with Bach&#39;s scrawls on it and the complete originality of the work has lead many music historians to doubt its provenance; the one-off nature and the very un-Bach-like characteristics of the piece have been at the root, since the 1980s at least, of a growing body of opinion among musicologists that Toccata and Fugue&nbsp;can&#39;t be Bach&#39;s work.

The 1812 Overture is perhaps best known for its rousing climactic volley of cannon fire, ringing chimes and brass fanfare finale.

Never mind what the audiences back then thought: it was the dancers who gave the composer a particularly hard time, declaring his music to be simply too difficult to dance to.

Today, the ballet is adored by young and old: from the graceful Waltz in Act I to the playful Dance of the Cygnets, this is wonderfully innocent music. Tchaikovsky evidently enjoyed composing the music for Swan Lake, writing far more material than would ever be required.

In 1886, the Philharmonic Society commissioned his Third Symphony, premiered in London at the St. James&rsquo;s Hall on 19 May, conducted by the composer himself. He later dedicated the work to his dear friend and supporter from those early days in Paris, Franz Liszt, who&rsquo;s died in the summer of 1886.

The 3rd movement begins with country dancing and a merry time generally being had by all but listen out for the end of the movement, when the music suddenly stops (this is the point when the peasants realise it&#39;s started to rain). From there, the thunderstorm begins. The music&#39;s initially quite light and sparse reflecting just the odd raindrop here and there but it rapidly grows and develops, as the rain falls more rapidly. The musical mood of the final section is unashamedly joyful: the rain has gone, the merrymaking can continue, and all is well!"},

That is, it&#39;s not about astronomy. Rather, it&#39;s about astrology. So we are not hearing a suite of tributes to, say, Saturn, the planet with rings around it. Instead Holst is writing about Mars, the bringer of war; Venus, the bringer of peace; Mercury, the winged messenger; Saturn the bringer of old age; Uranus, the magician; and Neptune, the mystic. &#39;Jupiter&#39;, arguably the most famous and most popular movement of Holst&#39;s magnificent suite, is the bringer of jollity. Holst&#39;s piece then has no thunderbolts to hurtle down on us nor war to wage. Instead it is a joyous and stirring rump of great tunes. The vigorous and jovial opening melodies soon give way to a stately rendition of a tune that is better known as the hymn &#39;I vow to thee my country&#39;, a patriotic number that Elgar could have easily conjured up."},

The work itself seems to be breaking out of conventional boundaries almost as if a new kind of music is being born. The sheer length of the opening movement belies convention; the serene second movement flows directly and unusually into the finale; and the overt romance of the music looks ahead to a musical period that was at that time still in its infancy. Apparently, the work&#39;s nickname derived not from Beethoven but from a comment made by one of Napoleon&#39;s officers, who was stationed in Vienna at the time. It was, &#39;an emperor of a concerto,&#39; the man supposedly exclaimed, and the name has stuck ever since."},

Well, one particular legend, to be precise. Mozart, when he was a teenager, so the story goes, once heard Allegri&#39;s Miserere&nbsp;being performed in the Sistine Chapel. The precocious young composer apparently scurried home and wrote down the entire work from memory. Wonderful as the story sounds, it would have been highly likely that Mozart would have come across the Miserere before, given its already significant popularity in musical circles. The work itself is a sublime nine-voice setting of Psalm 51: Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misercordiuam tuam (&#39;have mercy upon me, O God, after Thy great goodness&#39;). As you listen to the heavenly sound of each interweaving voice, it&#39;s fascinating to think that Allegri composed the piece for two separate choirs: one of four voices, and the other of five."},

On closer inspection then, &#39;Nimrod&#39;&nbsp;reveals itself to be a typical Elgarian pun as both Jaegar and Nimrod are connected to the word &#39;hunter&#39;. Jaeger is &#39;hunter&#39; in German and the word &#39;nimrod&#39; derives from the word &#39;hunter&#39;, as in, &#39;Nimrod the mighty hunter&#39; from the book of Genesis. Yet despite the mighty imagery &#39;Nimrod&#39;&nbsp;conjures up, this is not a jovial piece. Its sweeping elegiac lines have made it a recurring choice at funerals and other solemn occasions including at the Cenotaph in London on Remembrance Sunday. Elgar said of &#39;Nimrod&#39;&nbsp;that the variation is not really a portrait, but &#39;the story of something that happened&#39;, and he suggested that the quiet opening of the piece is a nod to Beethoven&#39;s Piano Sonata No. 8."},

Partly inspired by a poem written by English poet George Meredith, The Lark Ascending&nbsp;starts subtly with hushed strings which introduced the lark in the form of the solo violin. The soaring violin melody ascends so high into the instrument&#39;s upper register that, at times, it is barely audible; shimmering strings, meanwhile, provide much of the beautifully sensitive accompaniment in The Lark Ascending, evoking glorious images of the rolling British countryside. Midway through, Vaughan Williams treats us to an orchestral section that seems to borrow from his love of folk songs; it&#39;s not long, though, before the lark returns, with the melody entwining itself around the orchestra and then breaking free, rising to ever loftier heights. Just beautiful. No other words for it."},

It was, we&#39;re rather proud to say, given its premiere at a Classic FM Live concert in the autumn of 2000 at London&#39;s Royal Albert Hall. Many sections of the work are worthy of close examination not least the &#39;Agnus Dei&#39;&nbsp;and the &#39;Sanctus&#39;&nbsp;but it&#39;s the haunting &#39;Benedictus&#39; that captivates listeners to the greatest extent, leaving them begging for more.

The work was composed between the autumn of 1900 and April 1901. After the criticism of his Symphony No. 1 (now considered to be a great piece itself), Rachmaninov fell into a depression that lasted several years, fueled by growing problems in his personal life. His Piano Concerto No. 2 confirmed his recovery from clinical depression and writer&rsquo;s block, cured only by a course of hypnotherapy. The concerto was dedicated to Nikolai Dahl, a physician who had done much to restore Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s self-confidence. Unusually, the second and third movements were performed first, with Rachmaninov himself as the soloist on 2 December 1900. The complete work was then premiered, again with the composer as soloist, on 9 November 1901, with his cousin Alexander Siloti conducting. The critics were enthralled by glorious melody after glorious melody that flowed from the keyboard, the divine dialogue between orchestra and soloist, and ultimately, Rachmaninov had a hit on his hands.&nbsp;"}
